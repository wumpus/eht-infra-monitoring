Encode metadata in tags, which are indexed. Make sure there aren't too
many values for this metadata, i.e. "stations" being a station name is
OK (11 possible values), but don't put a time there.

Field values are not indexed.

To say this another way,

Index cardinality = buckets x measurements x (unique tag key,value pairs) x field keys

vlbimon schema:

2 bucket names, vlbimon_test and vlbimon_prod

The "measurement" acts like a db table name. Fields are like database
columns. The timestemp is a row.

Vlbimon timestamps are set to precision of 1 second, to save storage.
